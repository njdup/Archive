Algorithms and Data Structures to Implement
-------------------------------------------
- Hashing:
  - Build a framework for grabbing a hash function from a
    desired hash family
      - model after 166 problem set
  - Linear probing hash table (rust? java?)
  - Robin hood Hashing
  - Cuckoo Hashing
  - Classic chaining hash table
  - Dynamic FKS hashing

- Randomized Data Structures:
  - Bloom Filter
  - Quotient Filter
  - Count sketch

- Heaps
  - Binomial Heap (rust)
  - Fibonacci heap (rust)
  - Soft Heap
  - Shadow Heap
  - Pairing heap
  - Brodal queue
  - Treap

- Trees
  - Splay Tree
    - w/ normal recursive splaying
    - w/ top-down splaying
  - Red-Black Tree
  - B-Tree
  - Fusion Tree
  - Disjoint set data Structure
  - Van Emde Boas tree
  - x-Fast trie
  - y-Fast trie
  - Kd-tree
  - Segment Tree
  - Tango Tree
  - Trie

- Skip List
- Suffix Tree (Ukkonen's Algorithm)
- DAWG
- Suffix Array
- Aho Corasick Automaton
- Fischer-Heun RMQ Structure

- Max Flow Algorithms
  - push-relabel
  - Dinic's algorithm
  - Edmonds-Karp
  - Ford-Fulkerson

- Hungarian Algorithm (for min-cost perfect matching)
- Multiplicative weights Algorithm (Java)
  - + a framework for "online" problems (Java)
- Christofide's TSP approximation Algorithm
- Topological Sort

- Various Graph Algorithms
  - Dijkstra's
  - Kruskal's
  - Prim's


Things to lookup and learn
--------------------------

- Functional Programming (Haskell yay)
- Tabulation Hashing
- How to generate multiple hash functions
- Purely functional data structures

Things to figure out
--------------------
- Make interface for Graphs
  - then implement data structures that adhere to that interface
  - this will make coding graph algorithms easier :)
