Misc. Ideas
-----------
- Make interface for Graphs
  - then implement data structures that adhere to that interface
  - this will make coding graph algorithms easier :)
- Build a platform for running performance benchmark testing on data structures/algorithms
  - Could this be done programming language agnostic?
